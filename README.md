## Description of Dataset:

You already know the world is facing with such a brisk pace and so do the diseases, and to cure the diseases, doctors have to devote their precious time and experience that they had. But what is more concerning is the increasing number of patients than ever before, which results in more doctors and manual work. Instead of doing that, wouldn't it be awesome if we have a model which can predict whether a patient is going to have or has a particular disease or not ? That’s what we are talking about here.
	 The aim of this model is to predict whether a patient is going to have a heart failure or not based on certain input features. After that, we’re going to evaluate and find out how well our model is working.
	The dataset includes different parameters which are helpful to cut down the chase and helps us to know the target variable. These are the following parameters included:

'age': 				Continuous variable
'anaemia': 			Categorical variable
'creatinine_phosphokinase': 	Continuous variable
'diabetes': 			Categorical variable
'ejection_fraction': 		Continuous variable
'high_blood_pressure': 	Categorical variable
'platelets': 			Continuous variable
'serum_creatinine': 		Continuous variable
'serum_sodium': 		Continuous variable
'sex': 				Categorical variable
'smoking': 			Categorical variable
'time': 				Continuous variable
'DEATH_EVENT': 		Categorical variable
